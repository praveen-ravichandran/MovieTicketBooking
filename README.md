#### Ticket Booking API

The booking API checks for the availability of the seats based on the criteria for a particular movie show and books the ticket.
The criteria for the seat availability check are,
 - Seats should have not been booked and paid earlier for the show.
 - Booking confirmed seats has to be paid within 2 minutes. If not, the seats will be made available for other users to book.
 - Seats that are currently in review will not be available for particular time(30s).

## MovieTicketBookingConfirmationBroker [ðŸ”—](./MovieTicketBookingConfirmationBroker)

The Ticket Confirmation Broker System is an autonomous scheduled task that is configured to run at a fixed delay of one second between worker execution.

The role of the worker is to,
- Retrieve all the booked tickets that are yet to be reviewed
- Check and confirm/reject the tickets based on the criteria. The criteria are,
  - Seats are blocked on a first-come-first-served basis.
  - If the same seat is chosen by more than one booking, then the booking which blocks the max number of seats is confirmed.
  - If there is a tie between bookings, then one booking is randomly confirmed and other bookings are rejected.

Future Scope:
A Websocket instance which pushes the ticket booking status pertaining to the unique reqId.
