#### Ticket Booking API

The booking API checks for the availability of the seats based on the criteria for a particular movie show and books the ticket.
The criteria for the seat availability check are,
 - Seats should have not been booked and paid earlier for the show.
 - Booking confirmed seats has to be paid within 2 minutes. If not, the seats will be made available for other users to book.
 - Seats that are currently in review will not be available for particular time(30s).

The Ticket Booking API is protected by the JWT Token based Authentication.
The Token has to be added in the header section of the request.

```
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

##### Response on Successful Ticket Blocking:

A unique request Id will be returned. The system is designed in such a way that the reqId shall be used for the Third party Payments as well as to push/track the ticket status through Websocket.

```
{
  "reqId": <unique-transaction-id>
}
```

## MovieTicketBookingConfirmationBroker [ðŸ”—](./MovieTicketBookingConfirmationBroker)

The Ticket Confirmation Broker System is an autonomous scheduled task that is configured to run at a fixed delay of one second between worker execution.

The role of the worker is to,
- Retrieve all the booked tickets that are yet to be reviewed
- Check and confirm/reject the tickets based on the criteria. The criteria are,
  - Seats are blocked on a first-come-first-served basis.
  - If the same seat is chosen by more than one booking, then the booking which blocks the max number of seats is confirmed.
  - If there is a tie between bookings, then one booking is randomly confirmed and other bookings are rejected.

Future Scope:
A Websocket instance which pushes the ticket booking status pertaining to the unique reqId.
